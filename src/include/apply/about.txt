Guild applications are a way to help a guild's moderators manage new members.

Applicants will be presented with an in-app form that asks 1-5 questions, which should be answered truthfully and to the best of the member's ability. If you aren't comfortable answering a question, that's okay! You don't have to.

Once an application form is submitted, the moderators of the guild will look over your responses and decide whether you are a suitable fit for the guild. Once decided, you will also receive a notification directly from MrManager informing you of the result, however you must have direct messages enabled. If your application is accepted, you will automatically be granted access to the server.

Please also keep in mind that your answers are stored, so don't include any personal information (see the data command for more information).

If you have any concerns you may message <@206260650010345483> directly! We hope to hear from you soon!
