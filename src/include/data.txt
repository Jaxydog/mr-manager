Data stored by MrManager falls into the categories below.
For an exact view of what is stored, you may view the [current source code](https://github.com/Jaxydog/mr-manager), or the publicly archived [outdated source code](https://github.com/Jaxydog/MrManager).

**Bot Functionality:**
This includes values such as public identifiers or values input into commands.

Any data under this category is either already able to be viewed by other users, input directly by the user through commands or modals, or generated by the bot (either from given data or from scratch).

**Record-Keeping:**
This includes data such as the responses to your guild application and previous poll inputs and answers.

Any data under this category is stored entirely for the purpose of server moderation. Storing these values allows moderators to look back on user activity to ensure no server rules are broken.

Stored data will __never__ be shared with a third party. MrManager is made entirely for fun and there are no wishes to profit off of it.
For any concerns, you may contact <@206260650010345483> directly.
